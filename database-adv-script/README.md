## Task 0: SQL Joins

In this task, I practiced writing different SQL JOIN queries to combine data across multiple tables.

- **INNER JOIN** between `bookings` and `users` to display booking details along with user names.
- **LEFT JOIN** between `properties` and `reviews` to show all properties and their reviews (if available).
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** to list all users and bookings, including unmatched records.

## Task 1: SQL Subqueries

This task involved using subqueries to filter and analyze data.

- **Non-correlated subquery** to list properties with an average rating above 4.
- **Correlated subquery** to find users who have written more than two reviews.
